# This is the gitlab code owners file
# lines starting with a `#` will be ignored.
# 
# We can specify a default match using wildcards:
# * @default-codeowner
# Rules defined later in the file take precedence over the rules
# defined before.
#
# This will match all files for which the file name ends in `.rb`
# *.rb @ruby-owner
# Files with a `#` can still be accesssed by escaping the pound sign
# \#file_with_pound.rb @owner-file-with-pound
#
# Multiple codeowners can be specified, separated by spaces or tabs
# CODEOWNERS @multiple @code @owners
#
# Both usernames or email addresses can be used to match
# users. Everything else will be ignored. For example this will
# specify `@legal` and a user with email `janedoe@gitlab.com` as the
# owner for the LICENSE file
# LICENSE @legal this_does_not_match janedoe@gitlab.com
#
# Group names can be used to match groups and nested groups to specify
# them as owners for a file
# README @group @group/with-nested/subgroup
#
# Ending a path in a `/` will specify the code owners for every file
# nested in that directory, on any level
# /docs/ @all-docs
#
# Ending a path in `/*` will specify code owners for every file in
# that directory, but not nested deeper. This will match
# `docs/index.md` but not `docs/projects/index.md`
# /docs/* @root-docs
#
# This will make a `lib` directory nested anywhere in the repository
# match
# lib/ @lib-owner
# 
# This will only match a `config` directory in the root of the
# repository
# /config/ @config-owner
#
# If the path contains spaces, these need to be escaped like this:
# path\ with\ spaces/ @space-owner
